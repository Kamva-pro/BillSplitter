Project Overview
BillSplitter is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of splitting bills at restaurants. Users can upload the menu of a restaurant, and the app will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the menu data. Once the data is extracted and saved, users can select their meals, and the app will handle the bill splitting.
